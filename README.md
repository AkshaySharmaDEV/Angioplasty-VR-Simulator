# About the project:
The Angioplasty VR Simulator is an application designed for users who wish to learn, understand, and familiarize themselves with the angioplasty procedure through immersive virtual reality. Whether the user is a medical student or an aspiring surgeon, they can access this application at any time to receive training on performing angioplasty procedures. The project is currently compatible with PC-based virtual reality systems such as Oculus Quest and HTC Vive, allowing users to connect their head-mounted display (HMD) to a computer either wired or wirelessly. The Angioplasty VR Simulator aims to provide a lifelike and engaging experience to users.

By utilizing virtual reality technology, this application allows users to immerse themselves in a realistic virtual environment, replicating the angioplasty procedure. Through interactive simulations, users can actively participate in the procedure, gaining hands-on experience and improving their understanding of the process.

The primary focus of the Angioplasty VR Simulator is to provide an accurate representation of the angioplasty procedure. Users can learn about the steps involved in inserting a catheter, navigating it through blood vessels, locating blockages or narrowings, and performing balloon angioplasty. 

This VR application serves as a valuable educational tool, supplementing traditional training methods for medical professionals. It enables users to practice their skills, develop their hand-eye coordination, and enhance their decision-making abilities in a risk-free environment. The simulator can also provide detailed visualizations and interactive explanations to further augment the learning process.

It is worth noting that the Angioplasty VR Simulator is not intended to replace real-world training or serve as a substitute for supervised medical procedures. It is meant to complement existing educational resources, providing an additional avenue for learners to gain practical knowledge and experience in a controlled and immersive virtual environment.

# What is Angioplasty? - 
Angioplasty is a medical procedure used to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels, typically arteries, in the body. It is most commonly performed on coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle, but can also be done on other arteries such as those in the legs, kidneys, or brain.
